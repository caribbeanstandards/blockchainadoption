### Mapping Problem Areas to Potential Actions

On this page we identify action items that can be tied back to the problems/opportunities identified previously in our [exploration of â€˜whyâ€™](10-why.md) for blockchain technology in the region. Each action is mapped against the specific problem/opportunity it addresses.

In the instances where there are entities currently working on specific actions, those efforts are linked back to the relevant actions here from our [identification of â€˜howâ€™](30-how.md) page.
