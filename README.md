# Blockchain in the Caribbean

This repository (repo) represents an exercise in scanning the Caribbean landscape and exploring the potential role of blockchain technology in the region and how we might help realise this role. The repo contains a generic problem-space-analysis done from first principles that seeks to map a set of tangible levers **that anyone can pull** to help advance the blockchain agenda in the region.

### Using this repo

The repo starts with a general framing of the exercise on this page and then flows into an exploration of [the 'why' of blockchain adoption](10-why.md). Building on this, we then move on to a mapping of potential actions on [our identification 'what'](20-what.md) page. On our final page in our [listing of 'how'](30-how.md), we identify those entities that are executing some of the actions previously identified.

*A navigation bar can be found at the top of each page.*

## Framing the general space

*   **Framing 'blockchain' as a domain**

    The blockchain space is a relatively new phenomenon that has been gaining traction only in the last few years. It is primarily focused around explorations into the development of and applications surrounding the implementation of blockchain technology in various ways. Although very early still, the key value proposition of the technology appears to be in fundamentally changing the way we deal with ‘trust’ within our economic & social interactions at all levels of society, and how this in turn can potentially shape how the very fabrics of our institutions, businesses and interpersonal interactions are made up.

*   **Framing 'the Caribbean' as a domain**

    The Caribbean region is a unique one made up of a number of independent small-island states scattered across the Caribbean Sea and touching into some parts of Central and South America. Its unique make-up as a region presents an interesting potential as both a testing ground and an early implementer of different aspects of the blockchain space.


*   **Framing blockchain’s potential role in the Caribbean**

    The challenge of this exercise is to try to marry these two domains. It will be to identify those unique aspects of ***the Caribbean*** that can allow the region to credibly compete with other jurisdictions around the world, and to then identify what aspects of ***the blockchain space*** can most easily lend themselves to being integrated into this competitive advantage. It will also be to identify what internal-facing challenges we have as a region and to explore whether any aspects of this new technology and space can also be applied to helping to address these.


Mapping the problem space
---


>“If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”

The often-shared quote above captures in a nutshell how we’d like to go about tackling the challenge of blockchain adoption and leveraging blockchain technology within the Caribbean region.

Our approach through this repo will be to first identify and explore various relevant problem/challenge sets that could be applicable to this space and then to come up with solutions that can be linked to these problems/challenges. What we hope is that exercise can produce an ongoing mapping of relevant solution areas based on a logically consistent pathway to derive them.

Through this repository we will be [making these solution areas available](https://github.com/vindard/blockchaincaribbean/blob/master/README.md#usage) as a framework that anyone can apply via different executions and within different vehicles to move the blockchain adoption agenda forward in the region.
